# How to be Lazy: Bulk Management with Domo’s API
In this advanced session led by a Domo Data Scientist, you will learn how to use Domo’s public APIs to copy permissions across data sets, manage group and page permissions, and transfer data using Domo’s Python SDK.

The Jupyter notebook here contains all of the examples from the breakout session plus a bonus section on how to create a data set in Domo and upload data.
